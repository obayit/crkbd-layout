# Obi layout

This is Markstos layout with very minor customization

Ideas
=====

- use double keys more, specially for stuff that i am struggling with, like backspace, and find word under cursor in vim
- add macros for common vs code shortcuts (namely: open terminal, open finder, open git compare)
